# FHDA MyPortal Patcher

Patches the Foothill-De Anza MyPortal & SSB to fix common issues.

Currently fixes SAML validation errors, such as "Error validating SAML message".

## Installation

For now, the extension needs to be manually installed as it is not published in the webstore.

Instructions for Chrome:

1. [Download the .zip](https://github.com/madhavarshney/fhda-myportal-patcher/zipball/main/) and unpack it. Feel free to rename the unzipped folder.
2. Type `chrome://extensions` in the URL bar and press enter (or open the three dots menu > "More Tools" > "Extensions")
3. Turn on developer mode (toggle the switch in the top right corner)
4. Click "Load Unpacked" and choose the folder unzipped earlier to add the extension
5. Enjoy (and please report bugs!)
